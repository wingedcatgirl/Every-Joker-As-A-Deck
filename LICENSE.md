# Minty's Incredibly Dumb License

1. If money isn't involved, you can do anything you want with my stuff as long as you're nice and also cite your sources. (e.g. Any redistributions of the code must include a link back to the original GitHub repository.)
2. If you want money to be involved - I really don't recommend that, in this context. But if you're doing it anyway you have to get my permission.
3. Don't use my stuff to violate someone else's rights.
4. As you might gather from the name, I don't recommend others copy this license. But you can if you really think it's a good idea.
